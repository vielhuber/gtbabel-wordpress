Gtbabel automatically translates your HTML/PHP pages – server sided!

== Description ==
-   Gtbabel extracts on every page load any page into logical paragraph tokens.
-   Static and dynamic content is deliberately treated the same.
-   All tokens are replaced (if available) by it's translation before rendered.
-   The tokens get dumped (if not available) into gettext, where they can be translated.

3. Install and activate the plugin as usual from the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress.
